# B.S.-Thesis
Directory for files used or otherwise necessary for my bachelor's thesis: [Using deep learning with transformer networks to assess the stability of perovskite oxides.](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/119503)

## Folders
- crabnet_reproduction
    - contains the CrabNet paper results, as well as my reproduction of their results

- data
    - contains the data used, as well as the different splits and analyses of these. 
    - contains other files related to data processing and analysis

- figures
    - contains figures from the thesis.
    
- models
    - contains results from all the different models used in the thesis. Some of the trained models are saved in their respective files as pth files. These can be used to predict energy above hull for material formulas. This can be done by using the CrabNet programs function of loading a previously trained network. More instructions on installing CrabNet can be found at https://github.com/anthony-wang/CrabNet/blob/master/README_CrabNet.md
